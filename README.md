### Summary

This project investigates the barriers faced by women in obtaining grant funding in Russia, using data from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research from 1994-2016. The goal is to identify patterns of funding outcomes and applicant characteristics that may contribute to gender disparities.

### Data

The project uses grant application data from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, which includes about 400,000 applications, spanning over two decades. An example of an applicant card can be found here: https://www.rfbr.ru/rffi/ru/project_search/o_1910847. The final dataset is posted on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/3xv9a/.
